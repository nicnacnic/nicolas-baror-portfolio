        <p>With my successful design of <a href="https://www.nicolasbaror.com/gallery/cinderella"><i>Cinderella</i></a>
            the year prior, <a href="https://www.stageleftct.org">Stage Left Children's Theater</a> hired me once again
            to design their production of <i>Seussical</i>. This time around, the design process was a little different,
            as I got hired right at the start, and had the ability to add and change things as I desired.</i></p>

        <p>The challenge this year was time. Being the only person on team lighting, it fell on me to hang, focus, and
            design the entire show. The limitations of the space didn't help; only having one way to get to each
            electric limited the amount of fixtures we could hang at once. With all that, the lighting department fell
            behind, with me doing as much as possible to get the rig up and running and programmed before tech began.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the limited amount of time, I was able to get everything done and looking great! A nice addition
            this year was two moving lights, giving a lot more flexibility to craft the weird and fanatical world of
            Seuss that the director was looking for. The color palette was equally interesting, with more saturate and
            wacky colors used throughout to make it feel more fun!
